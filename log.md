# 365 Days Of Watching and Praying - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2018 
##### Focus: Decision-making

**Today's Progress**: I studied the book of Daniel 1.

**Thoughts:** Today, I started a journey on understanding decision-making from the point of view of scriptures. I got to understand from that chapter that the best decisions are usually those where the underlying motive is to obey God (vs 9). The end result was that God backed him up, distinguished him and his friends and made him relevant for close to 65 years in a strange land.

**Lesson:**
* You never lose relevance when your desire is to please God

### Day 2: January 2, 2018 
##### Focus: Decision-making II

**Today's Progress**: I studied the book of Ezra 7.

**Thoughts:** Today, I studied more on decision making through the eyes of the bible patriarch - Ezra. He was of priestly descent (Aaron's lineage) and he was a in exile in Babylon until he decided to return to Jerusalem. His desire was to study God's word and teach the same to God's people (vs 10). This obviously delighted God as I saw how Ezra never needed to spend a dime for his return to Jerusalem and in the execution of his assignment at Jerusalem (vs 6, 18, 21-24). 

**Lesson:**
* Always expect divine provision/supplies anytime your desire/decision/vision pleases God - Ps. 37:4

### Day 3: January 3, 2018 
##### Focus: Decision-making III

**Today's Progress**: I studied the book of 1 Sam. 29 & 30.

**Thoughts:** David was a man after God's heart and made his decisions by enquiring from God (30:8). In Chapter 29 we saw how he was rejected from joining in a battle against Israel which I believed caused him to return in good time to Ziklag to save his family from being taken into captivity 

**Lesson:**
* Always enquire from the Lord for your every step - 1 Sam. 30:8
* Not all rejections are bad. They might God's way of leading his people away from heart break - 1 Sam. 29:6


### Day 4: January 4, 2018 
##### Focus: Decision-making IV

**Today's Progress**: I studied the book of Genesis 3.

**Thoughts:** God created man to be a creature of choice - Deut. 30:19. Apart from just given us options to choose from he also instructs on the best choice to make. Obeying God delivers from curses

**Lesson:**
* Be ready to follow to the latter every commandment God gives especially from the scriptures - Ps. 119:9. Doing this not only cleanses us but averts curses on out behalf


### Day 5: January 5, 2018 
##### Focus: Decision-making V

**Today's Progress**: I studied the book of Genesis 4.

**Thoughts:** Our decision to give to God can either please or displease him (4:4-5). He is only pleased when we give him our best as he is not in need but only commits to meeting our needs.

**Lesson:**
* God is interested in how and what I give - Mal. 1:14, 3:10


### Day 6: January 6, 2018 
##### Focus: Decision-making 

**Today's Progress**: I studied the book of Genesis 5.

**Thoughts:** Our decision to walk with God impacts greatly on our children. Enoch walked with God (vs 24) and produced a child that lived the longest of all born of man.

**Lesson:**
* Longevity, wealth and riches dwells in the lineage and family of everyone who truly walks in the fear of God - Ps. 112:1-3


### Day 7: January 7, 2018 
##### Focus: Decision-making 

**Today's Progress**: I studied the book of Genesis 6.

**Thoughts:** God is interested in whom we decide to marry. He wants godly seed in the end and so wants his children to be guided when choosing. Failing to follow the will of God for marriage can result in the early deaths (vs. 2-3)


### Day 8: January 8, 2018 
##### Focus: Decision-making 

**Today's Progress**: I studied the book of Genesis 8.

**Thoughts:** While waiting for God's marching order to leave the ark, Noah took steps by sending out birds `(v 7-8)` to assess the condition of the earth. This agrees with `Prov. 16:1` where it reads,
```
A preparations of the heart belong to man, but the answer of the tongue is from the Lord
```
It is important to take steps while waiting for the Lord's voice on every situation - `Gen. 26:1-3`. In the account of Isaac, we saw that as a result of the famine he decided to head to Egypt but as he made his moves, God met him and told him where to stay. Interestingly, his first port of call was where God wanted him to be. I believe this is why it reads in `Is. 30:21`
```
Your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, "This is the way, walk in it," 
whenever you turn to the right hand or whenever you turn to the left.
```


### Day 9: January 9, 2018 
##### Focus: Decision-making 

**Today's Progress**: I studied the books of Genesis 12 and 13.

**Thoughts:** God leads individuals and not groups.



### Day 10: January 10, 2018 
##### Focus: Decision-making 

**Today's Progress**: I studied the book of Genesis 25.

**Thoughts:** Any unpleasant situation that is not addressed is permitted to remain (vs 21). It is thus important not to watch negative trends continue in ones lineage - 1 Chr. 4:9-10 but to deal with them precisely in prayer coupled with fasting.



### Day 11: January 11, 2018 
##### Focus: Decision-making 

**Today's Progress**: Today I explored the book of Genesis 26.

**Thoughts:** It is important never to give up on our engagements as consistency sets the pace to honour and dignity. Isaac was never deterred from building wells and soon his enemies got weary of him.
