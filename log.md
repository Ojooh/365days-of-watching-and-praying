# 365 Days Of Watching and Praying - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2018 
##### Focus: Decision-making

**Today's Progress**: I studied the book of Daniel 1.

**Thoughts:** Today I started a journey on understanding decision-making from the point of view of scriptures. I got to understand that we make the best decisions when the underlying motive is to obey God.
