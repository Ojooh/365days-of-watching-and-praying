# 365 Days Of Watching and Praying - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2018 
##### Focus: Decision-making

**Today's Progress**: I studied the book of Daniel 1.

**Thoughts:** Today, I started a journey on understanding decision-making from the point of view of scriptures. I got to understand from that chapter that the best decisions are usually those where the underlying motive is to obey God (vs 9). The end result was that God backed him up, distinguished him and his friends and made him relevant for close to 65 years in a strange land.
