# 365 Days Of Watching and Praying - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2018 
##### Focus: Decision-making

**Today's Progress**: I studied the book of Daniel 1.

**Thoughts:** Today, I started a journey on understanding decision-making from the point of view of scriptures. I got to understand from that chapter that the best decisions are usually those where the underlying motive is to obey God (vs 9). The end result was that God backed him up, distinguished him and his friends and made him relevant for close to 65 years in a strange land.

**Lesson:**
* You never lose relevance when your desire is to please God

### Day 2: January 2, 2018 
##### Focus: Decision-making II

**Today's Progress**: I studied the book of Ezra 7.

**Thoughts:** Today, I studied more on decision making through the eyes of the bible patriarch - Ezra. He was of priestly descent (Aaron's lineage) and he was a in exile in Babylon until he decided to return to Jerusalem. His desire was to study God's word and teach the same to God's people (vs 10). This obviously delighted God as I saw how Ezra never needed to spend a dime for his return to Jerusalem and in the execution of his assignment at Jerusalem (vs 6, 18, 21-24). 

**Lesson:**
* Always expect divine provision/supplies anytime your desire/decision/vision pleases God - Ps. 37:4

### Day 3: January 3, 2018 
##### Focus: Decision-making III

**Today's Progress**: I studied the book of 1 Sam. 29 & 30.

**Thoughts:** David was a man after God's heart and made his decisions by enquiring from God (30:8). In Chapter 29 we saw how he was rejected from joining in a battle against Israel which I believed caused him to return in good time to Ziklag to save his family from being taken into captivity 

**Lesson:**
* Always enquire from the Lord for your every step - 1 Sam. 30:8
* Not all rejections are bad. They might God's way of leading his people away from heart break - 1 Sam. 29:6


### Day 4: January 4, 2018 
##### Focus: Decision-making IV

**Today's Progress**: I studied the book of Genesis 3.

**Thoughts:** God created man to be a creature of choice - Deut. 30:19. Apart from just given us options to choose from he also instructs on the best choice to make. Obeying God delivers from curses

**Lesson:**
* Be ready to follow to the latter every commandment God gives especially from the scriptures - Ps. 119:9. Doing this not only cleanses us but averts curses on out behalf


### Day 5: January 5, 2018 
##### Focus: Decision-making V

**Today's Progress**: I studied the book of Genesis 4.

**Thoughts:** Our decision to give to God can either please or displease him (4:4-5). He is only pleased when we give him our best as he is not in need but only commits to meeting our needs.

**Lesson:**
* God is interested in how and what I give - Mal. 1:14, 3:10


### Day 6: January 6, 2018 
##### Focus: Decision-making 

**Today's Progress**: I studied the book of Genesis 5.

**Thoughts:** Our decision to walk with God impacts greatly on our children. Enoch walked with God (vs 24) and produced a child that lived the longest of all born of man.

**Lesson:**
* Longevity, wealth and riches dwells in the lineage and family of everyone who truly walks in the fear of God - Ps. 112:1-3


### Day 7: January 7, 2018 
##### Focus: Decision-making 

**Today's Progress**: I studied the book of Genesis 6.

**Thoughts:** God is interested in whom we decide to marry. He wants godly seed in the end and so wants his children to be guided when choosing. Failing to follow the will of God for marriage can result in the early deaths (vs. 2-3)


### Day 8: January 8, 2018 
##### Focus: Decision-making 

**Today's Progress**: I studied the book of Genesis 8.

**Thoughts:** While waiting for God's marching order to leave the ark, Noah took steps by sending out birds `(v 7-8)` to assess the condition of the earth. This agrees with `Prov. 16:1` where it reads,
```
A preparations of the heart belong to man, but the answer of the tongue is from the Lord
```
It is important to take steps while waiting for the Lord's voice on every situation - `Gen. 26:1-3`. In the account of Isaac, we saw that as a result of the famine he decided to head to Egypt but as he made his moves, God met him and told him where to stay. Interestingly, his first port of call was where God wanted him to be. I believe this is why it reads in `Is. 30:21`
```
Your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, "This is the way, walk in it," 
whenever you turn to the right hand or whenever you turn to the left.
```


### Day 9: January 9, 2018 
##### Focus: Decision-making 

**Today's Progress**: I studied the books of Genesis 12 and 13.

**Thoughts:** God leads individuals and not groups.



### Day 10: January 10, 2018 
##### Focus: Decision-making 

**Today's Progress**: I studied the book of Genesis 25.

**Thoughts:** Any unpleasant situation that is not addressed is permitted to remain (vs 21). It is thus important not to watch negative trends continue in ones lineage - 1 Chr. 4:9-10 but to deal with them precisely in prayer coupled with fasting.



### Day 11: January 11, 2018 
##### Focus: Decision-making 

**Today's Progress**: Today I explored the book of Genesis 26.

**Thoughts:** It is important never to give up on our engagements and commitments as consistency sets the pace to honour and dignity. Isaac was never deterred from building wells **(he built five)** and soon his enemies got weary of him. Paul was deadly committed to his course of persecuting Christians until God met him. Mordecai was committed to serving God and the King Ahasuerus and he ended in a place of honour. The same trait can be observed in other patriarchs. 


### Day 12: January 12, 2018 
##### Focus: Decision-making 

**Today's Progress**: Today I explored the book of Genesis 28.

**Thoughts:** This chapter buttresses the fact that covenant children cannot just marry as others do (vs 1-2). In addition, the chapter mentions how Jacob made a vow to God as a result of divine encounter in a night vision.


### Day 13: January 13, 2018 
##### Focus: Decision-making 

**Today's Progress**: Today I explored the book of Genesis 35.

**Thoughts:** This chapter is the follow up of Genesis 28. Here, God reminds Jacob of the vow he made in chapter 28. This shows that God is always ready to fulfill His side of every vow and expects the same from the person who makes the vow.

**Lesson:**
* Never make vows that you are not ready to keep - Gen. 23:21-23, Eccl. 5:4-6


### Day 14: January 14, 2018 
##### Focus: Decision-making 

**Today's Progress**: Today I explored the book of Genesis 29 through 31.

**Thoughts:** Contrary situations are tell-tale signs that we are not yet at our place of rest.

**Lesson:**
* It is creativity that brings about prosperity - Gen. 30:37-43
* The creativity that Jacob encountered was a direct response to the vow he had earlier made while leaving his father's place for Laban's house - Gen. 31:10-13


### Day 15: January 15, 2018 
##### Focus: Decision-making - The power of vows 

**Today's Progress**: Today I explored the book of Genesis 32 and 33.

**Thoughts:** The vow that Jacob made to God at Bethel was what opened up his destiny - (vs 10).

**Lesson:**
* Any vow made with understanding will always deliver - Gen. 31:13


### Day 16: January 16, 2018 
##### Focus: Decision-making - The power of vows 

**Today's Progress**: Today I explored the books of Judges 11 and 1 Samuel 1.

**Thoughts:** The vow that Jephthah and Hannah made delivered without fail.


### Day 17: January 17, 2018 
##### Focus: Dreams

**Thoughts:** It is near imposible to kill a man with dreams.


### Day 18: January 18, 2018 
##### Focus: Dreams 

**Today's Progress**: Today I explored the book of Genesis 39.

**Thoughts:** 
* When God goes with a man, s/he experiences **success** (vs 2a), **mercy** (vs 21a), **favor** (vs 21b) and **prosperity** (vs 23) regardless of where s/he lives on the planet earth 
* However, to carry God's presence, we must be sure he is the one leading us and that we are also committed to pleasing him all the way - John 8:29


### Day 19: January 19, 2018 
##### Focus: Dreams 

**Today's Progress**: Today I explored the books of Genesis 40 and 41.

**Thoughts:** 
* Every incidence or relationship in the life of a man that God is going with happens for a reason - e.g. Joseph was not in Egypt by mistake. He went to prison on purpose and he met with the King's captive for the sole purpose of interpreting their dreams which would at the end result in his rise to power.
* Never depend on the help of any man in life's journey because unless God sends them to you, they will forget you (Gen. 40:23).
* Things might not take shape at the time you expect but at the fullness of time in God - Gen. 41:1, Eccl. 3:11
* Never despise little assignments and projects _(opportunities to be of help to others and to develop your capacity)_ in your journey through life - Gen. 42:15
* Learn to save one-fifth of all your earnings for the future - Gen. 41:34

### Day 22: January 22, 2018 
##### Focus: Decision making - Lending a helping hand

**Today's Progress**: Today I explored the book of Exodus 2.

**Thoughts:** 
* Doors will always open to a man who is ready to lend a helping hand - Gen. 40: 7-8, Ex. 2:18-20


### Day 23: January 23, 2018

##### Focus: Decision making 

**Today's Progress**: Explored the book of Exodus 4.

**Thoughts:** 
* When God sends one on an assignment, he places all the requisite skills and abilities in him to carry out the assignment. This I believe is what is called GRACE.
* In order to carry out the assignment of God, Moses needed to be a keeper of the Covenant of Circumcision. In contemporary times, this stands for sanctification - Ps. 119:9. It is now a matter of the heart as Paul puts it than it is of the flesh - Rom. 2:28-29


### Day 28: January 28, 2018 
##### Focus: Decision making 

**Today's Progress**: Explored the book of Exodus 5.

**Thoughts:** 
* The fact that God is leading/speaking to a/an people/individual on the way to go does not mean they will not face challenges. However, in those challenges, God is making a way of escape - Ex. 5:22-23.
* God's leadings may not make sense but they will always lead one out of captivity, stagnation and frustration.

* Whatever God says about an individual or nation, He is committed to perform. However, there is always what to do to see those words fulfilled and that involves warring - Josh. 21:45, I Tim. 1:18
