# 365 Days Of Watching and Praying - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2018 
##### Focus: Decision-making

**Today's Progress**: I studied the book of Daniel 1.

**Thoughts:** Today, I started a journey on understanding decision-making from the point of view of scriptures. I got to understand from that chapter that the best decisions are usually those where the underlying motive is to obey God (vs 9). The end result was that God backed him up, distinguished him and his friends and made him relevant for close to 65 years in a strange land.

**Lesson:**
* You never lose relevance when your desire is to please God

### Day 2: January 2, 2018 
##### Focus: Decision-making II

**Today's Progress**: I studied the book of Ezra 7.

**Thoughts:** Today, I studied more on decision making through the eyes of the bible patriarch - Ezra. He was of priestly descent (Aaron's lineage) and he was a in exile in Babylon until he decided to return to Jerusalem. His desire was to study God's word and teach the same to God's people (vs 10). This obviously delighted God as I saw how Ezra never needed to spend a dime for his return to Jerusalem and in the execution of his assignment at Jerusalem (vs 6, 18, 21-24). 

**Lesson:**
* Always expect divine provision/supplies anytime your desire/decision/vision pleases God - Ps. 37:4
